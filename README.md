Talking Uterus Project

This project was my senior design for a program that would cycle through a series of lights on a diorama while audio would play
explaining the female reproductive system. This was coded for a Arduino Mega 2560 Microcontroller. I am still sort of working on the project
at this time, so the 0.4 manually typed version is probably not going to be the final version, but the major components and
ideas are there. Much of the original program sequence was formatted in XML with the base program on the computer in python. 

This program interfaces with a Mac running a custom production program. The hardware is part Arduino that wires into 3
custom designed boards I made that give the system enough power to power the lights.
